          Throughout my career as a systems analyst, I have worked with various
          technologies such as JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js,
          ASP.NET, SQL, and MongoDB. This experience has enabled me to manage
          and develop innovative and scalable solutions. As a result, I am
          prepared to tackle projects in both backend and frontend development
          using these technologies.
